## Statistical Recommendations

### Priority Actions

#### CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required)
- **Model Performance**: Complete model overhaul required - current approach is fundamentally flawed
- **Expected Value**: Implement strict positive EV filtering before predictions

#### HIGH PRIORITY
- **Confidence Calibration**: Implement isotonic regression or Platt scaling for calibration

### Mathematical Model Adjustments

#### 1. Confidence Score Recalibration
```python
# Apply calibration correction based on historical performance
calibration_factors = {
    '95+': 0.000,
    '90-94': 0.000,
    '85-89': 0.000,
    # ... etc
}

adjusted_confidence = original_confidence * calibration_factors[bracket]
```

#### 2. Expected Value Filter
```python
# Only make predictions with positive expected value
implied_prob = 1 / decimal_odds
model_prob = confidence_score / 100
edge = model_prob - implied_prob

# Minimum edge requirement
if edge > 0.05:  # 5% minimum edge
    make_prediction = True
```

#### 3. Volume Optimization
Current average: 208 predictions/day
Recommended: 50-75 predictions/day (focus on highest conviction)

## Conclusion

The Hellraiser system shows significant issues requiring immediate attention. Key areas for improvement include:

1. **Confidence Calibration**: 84.7% average error requires systematic correction
2. **Volume Management**: Reduce prediction volume to improve quality
3. **Market Efficiency**: Poor correlation between market assessment and outcomes

**Recommended Implementation Timeline:**
- Week 1: Apply calibration corrections and EV filters
- Week 2-3: Optimize pathway criteria and reduce volume
- Month 2: Implement ensemble methods and advanced calibration
